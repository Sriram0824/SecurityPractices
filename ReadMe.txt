I used Firebase libraries to use JWT along with PHP. I created two pages the first one is InsertRecords.php which posts data into the database and the other one is GetRecords.php which brings the data from the database. I mentioned everything in the comments. The Composer file is used to generatre the libraries and the vendor folder has all the library files. Private folder has the file for the client key and client scret.
